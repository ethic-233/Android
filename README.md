Please modify the basketball scoring app which called CourtCounter. Add a new activity to set the names of two teams. And add a new activity to display the final scores of the two teams.

     (1) When you click on the Start button in the first activity, it will launch the second activity and pass the names of two teams. The second activity will keep track of the scores of a basketball game. 

     (2) When you click on the Game Over button in the second activity, it will launch the third activity and pass the final score. The third activity will then display the final score.

     (3) When the screen rotates, the app must continue counting and work normally.
